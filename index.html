    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I am committed to the mission of translating elusive business requirements into practical and implementable technology. I am tasked to facilitate communication amongst stakeholders and technical teams through the use of analytical reasoning, empathy, and data-driven analysis. In my quest to bring long-term value to an organization, I endeavor to make sound choices, streamline operations, and lead ethically.
    </p>

    <h2>Values and Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The initial conception of my IT Supervisor Readiness Portfolio was to produce a professional and performance-driven online presentation that demonstrated my leadership skills, decisive aptitude, and technical supervision skills, in line with my lifelong goal of becoming a Business Analyst. The central aim was to create a user-centered process that is data-informed and connects the operations of technologies and valuable business through sufficient IT oversight (Lee & Dong, 2023).
