            <h2>Ethical Dilemma Response</h2>
            <p>The supervisor in IT always gives high-priority assignments to some members of the team, claiming they
                are more reliable than others and have performed well in the past. Other potential employees who are
                equally capable are not offered such opportunities, which can lead to low morale and feelings of
                discrimination. This causes friction within and kills professional growth among the neglected employees.

            <p>This diagram illustrates a performance-enhancing feedback loop linking Customer Satisfaction, Employee
                Morale, and Productivity. Improved Response Time enhances Customer Satisfaction, which encourages a
                Positive Feedback Loop (Romano & Conti, 2024).</p>

            <h2>Personal Code of Ethics</h2>
            <p>Adequate IT supervision requires a strong personal code of ethics, especially in diverse and dynamic
                environments. Transparency helps to set clear expectations and decisions, as well as performance
                appraisal, to minimize instances of a lack of understanding and achieve team synergy (Dinh et al.,
                2021). Accountability enhances ownership at each level, and people are held accountable for their
                successes and errors.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Reflection</h2>
            <p>The process of transition between Indian and U.S IT culture suggests that there are some key differences
                in the manner of feedback and leadership management. Indian workplaces have feedback that is indirect
                and well-styled, and consequently, they mainly provide feedback during formal evaluations or team
                communication. </p>
